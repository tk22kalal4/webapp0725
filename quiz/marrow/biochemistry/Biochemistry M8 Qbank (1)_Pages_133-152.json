      "explanation": "Plasma levels of ornithine are elevated in gyrate atrophy of the retina and choroid.The initial reactions in arginine catabolism are the conversion of arginine to ornithine followed bythe transamination of ornithine. Any mutations in ornithine aminotransferase lead to elevatedplasma and urinary concentrations of ornithine.This is associated with a condition known as gyrate atrophy of the choroid and retina. It presentswith myopia and night blindness in adolescence which progresses to legal blindness by 50 years.The condition is treated with dietary restriction of arginine.150",

      "explanation": "Segawa syndrome is a hereditary progressive dystonia due to the deficiencyof tetrahydrobiopterin(BH4).Segawa syndrome, also known as dopamine-responsive dystonia occurs due to a defect in the GTPcyclohydrolase I enzyme required for BH4 synthesis.This condition is characterised by increased muscle tone and Parkinsonian features, typicallyabsent in the morning or after rest but worsening during the day and with exertion. Treatment forthis condition is with Levodopa.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Boiled cabbage odor in urine, sweat, and breath occurs inhypermethioninemia. Dimethylsulphide, a metabolite of methionine, causes the characteristicboiled cabbage smell.People with a genetic deficiency of a/ẞ-methionine adenosyltransferase present withhypermethioninemia and neural demyelination. However, they're usually asymptomatic untilearly adulthood.Methionine adenosyltransferase converts methionine to S-adenosyl Methionine (SAM) - aprincipal methyl donor. Hence the enzyme deficincy causes excess accumulation of methionineand its broken down to metabolites.",

      "explanation": "A fishy odor is seen in trimethylaminuria. Consumption of food products with choline should beavoided in fish odor syndrome.Fish odor syndrome (trimethylaminuria) is an autosomal recessive disease whereTMA(trimethylamine) is not converted to the non-odorous TMAO (TMA-N-oxide) in the liver. Thisis due to the deficiency of flavin-containing mono oxygenase 3 (FMO3). TMA then builds up in thebody and is released in sweat, urine, and breath, giving off a strong odor of rotting fish from thebody.Choline, lecithin, and TMAO are precursors of trimethylamine which are found in food products.These food products are eggs, liver, peanuts, meat, poultry, fish, dairy foods, pasta, and rice.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Urinary levels of 3-methylhistidine are decreased in patients with Wilson disease.151Amino acids in urine exist either in conjugated form (most) or in free form. In Wilson's diseasethe amount of conjugated amino acids far exceeds the amount of free amino acids. MethylHistidine largely exists in free form and does not increase in amount on hydrolysis of acids inurine. Hence low amounts is seen in Wilson's disease.Wilson disease is an autosomal-recessive disorder caused by mutation of the ATP7B gene locatedon chromosome 13. The ATP7B gene, encodes a transmembrane copper-transporting ATPase,expressed on the hepatocyte canalicular membrane.Deficiency in the ATP7B protein causes a decrease in copper excretion into the bile, impairs itsincorporation into ceruloplasmin, and inhibits ceruloplasmin secretion into the blood, leading tothe accumulation of toxic levels of copper in the liver, brain, and eye.",

      "options": {
        "A": "Homogentisate oxidase",
        "B": "Xanthine oxidase",
        "C": "Phenylalanine hydroxylase",
        "D": "Dihydro oratate dehydrogenase"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Urine turning black on exposure to air is suggestive of alkaptonuria which occurs due to the defectin homogentisate oxidase enzyme.Alkaptonuria is a disorder of tyrosine metabolism, that develops due to the defect inhomogentisate oxidase, which oxidizes homogentisate to maleylacetoacetate. The defect in thisenzyme leads to the accumulation of homogentisate, which is then excreted in the urine. Theexcreted homogentisate gets oxidized when exposed to the air and causes the urine to turn black.In some cases, the excessive homogentisate may get oxidized to benzoquinone acetate, whichbinds to the connective tissue. This leads to arthritis and pigmentation of the connective tissue, acondition called ochronosis.Other options:Option B: Xanthine oxidase deficiency results in hypouricemia, xanthinuria, and xanthinelithiasis.Option C: Defects in phenylalanine hydroxylase can lead to phenylketonuria characterised byhyperreflexia, seizures, hypopigmentation, low IQ, hyperactivity, and tremors.Option D: Defects in dihydroorotate dehydrogenase are rarely seen in clinical practice. Millersyndrome is associated with this defect.152",
