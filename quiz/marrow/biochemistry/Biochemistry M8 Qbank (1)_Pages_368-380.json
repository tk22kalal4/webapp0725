The three processes that contribute to purine nucleotide biosynthesis, in the order of decreasing importance, are: Synthesis from amphibolic intermediates, phosphoribosylation of purine bases, and phosphorylation of purine nucleosides.

      "explanation": "The rate-limiting step of de novo purine synthesis is the conversion of 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) to phosphoribosylamine by PRPP glutamyl amidotransferase. The first intermediate formed in the de novo pathway for purine biosynthesis is 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP). The rate-limiting enzyme is PRPP glutamyl amidotransferase.

      "explanation": "Allantoin is the end product of purine catabolism in a patient on rasburicase, a recombinant uricase enzyme. Uric acid is the natural end product of purine catabolism in humans. So, in conditions with high cell turnover, such as leukemia, lymphomas, and other malignancies, there is increased uric acid production. To prevent hyperuricemia, medications such as rasburicase are administered prophylactically. It is a recombinant uricase enzyme that converts uric acid to a water-soluble end product, allantoin, that is easily excreted by the kidneys. Note: In mammals other than primates, uricase is naturally occurring and allantoin is the end product of purine catabolism.",

      "explanation": "Uracil cannot be salvaged to its corresponding nucleotide. Pyrimidine bases cannot be salvaged to their corresponding nucleotides. Purine bases that are salvaged are adenine, hypoxanthine, and guanine. Salvage pathway - This pathway involves the conversion of purines to nucleosides and later to mononucleotides. It requires less energy than de novo synthesis. It usually occurs in places where de novo synthesis of purines is absent, like the brain, erythrocytes, etc. The enzymes that catalyze this reaction are: • Adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT) • Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT).",

        "D": "Purine nucleoside phosphorylase"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is highly suggestive of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. It is caused due to the complete deficiency of Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT). Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is an X-linked recessive disorder. This deficiency results in an inability to salvage hypoxanthine or guanine, from which excessive amounts of uric acid are produced and excreted in urine as orange sands. Clinical features include compulsive self-mutilation, hyperuricemia, intellectual disability, delayed milestones, dystonic movements, and megaloblastic anemia. Diagnosis is made by deficient HGPRTase enzyme activity in the erythrocyte. Partial deficiency of HGPRTase causes Kelley-Seegmiller syndrome. Other options: Option A: Adenine phosphoribosyltransferase enzyme deficiency causes urinary calculus formation with crystalluria. Option C: Adenosine deaminase enzyme deficiency is one of the 2nd major causes of SCID. Option D: Purine nucleoside phosphorylase causes a severe deficiency of T cells but B cells are normal.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The first true pyrimidine nucleotide formed in pyrimidine synthesis is UMP. UMP is formed from orotic acid by the enzyme orotate phosphoribosyltransferase (OPRTase). UMP is then immediately decarboxylated using orotidylic acid decarboxylase to produce UMP. Nucleotides CTP and TMP are then formed subsequently from UMP via CTP synthetase and thymidylate synthase. Methotrexate inhibits dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), which stops TMP synthesis. 5-Fluorouracil inhibits thymidylate synthase. OPRTase and orotidylic acid decarboxylase are two enzymes that are considered as a single polypeptide enzyme - UMP synthase. Deficiency of UMP synthase leads to orotic aciduria.",

      "explanation": "Uric acid is not a product of pyrimidine catabolism, it is a product of purine catabolism. All other options are products of pyrimidine catabolism. Unlike the low solubility products of purine catabolism, the catabolism of the pyrimidines forms highly water-soluble products, thus pyrimidine overproduction results in few clinical features. Cytosine and uracil form β-alanine, CO2, and NH3. Thymine forms β-amino isobutyrate, CO2, and NH3.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Hyperuricemia is not seen in xanthinuria. Xanthinuria occurs due to a defect in the enzyme xanthine oxidase. Xanthine oxidase catalyzes the conversion of hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid. It is associated with hypouricemia and xanthine lithiasis. Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is caused by complete deficiency of HGPRTase, whereas Kelley-Seegmiller syndrome is caused by the partial deficiency of HGPRTase. Purines accumulate, causing hyperuricemia. In von Gierke's disease, the oxidation of glucose-6-phosphate via the pentose phosphate pathway leads to increased production of ribose-5-phosphate, which activates the de novo synthesis of purine nucleotides. Overproduction of these nucleotides leads to their degradation, which causes hyperuricemia.",

      "explanation": "The above-given clinical findings are suggestive of xeroderma pigmentosum. A defect in the removal of oligonucleotides containing damaged bases by endonucleases is seen in xeroderma pigmentosum. Xeroderma Pigmentosum (XP) is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterized by defective DNA repair, which leads to clinical and cellular hypersensitivity to ultraviolet radiation and other carcinogenic agents. Important clinical features are: intense cutaneous photosensitivity, xerosis, poikiloderma, actinic keratosis, acute burning under minimal sun exposure, erythemas, hyperpigmented lentiginous macules, and malignant lesions in sun-exposed areas, including basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma. The final diagnosis of XP can be confirmed by special laboratory tests by examining the DNA damage repair in cells from cultures exposed to ultraviolet radiation. The most common tests are skin biopsy and culture of skin fibroblasts. There is no cure for XP. Treatment consists of minimizing exposure to sunlight and regular dermatological care, as well as surgery for recurrent tumor excision. Patients should be followed up every 3 months. Genetic counseling is important in a family that has an affected child and is considering having more children.",
