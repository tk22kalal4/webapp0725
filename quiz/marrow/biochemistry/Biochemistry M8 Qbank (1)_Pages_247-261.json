Therefore, LDL and HDL are considered the major carriers of cholesterol. IDLs are formed by the removal of triglycerides from VLDL by muscle and adipose tissue and are hence enriched in cholesterol. LDLs are derived from VLDL and IDL particles and contain more cholesterol than IDLs.",

They aresynthesized in the intestine by assembling apo B-48 with lipids (mainly triacylglycerols). This iscalled a nascent chylomicron, which upon receiving apo C-II and apo E from HDL is remodelledinto mature chylomicron.Apo C-II activates lipoprotein lipase present on the endothelium. Lipoprotein lipase hydrolyzesthe triacylglycerols into fatty acids and glycerol which are either used for storage or energy.Therefore, patients who are deficient in lipoprotein lipase or apo C-II (type Ihyperlipoproteinemia) show increased levels of chylomicrons in the plasma after a fatty meal.",

Insulin induces the activity of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), which is present on the capillary walls. LPL promotes hydrolysis of TG and the degradation of the transport proteins, VLDL, and chylomicrons.
