Synthesized in the body (by bacterial flora in the intestine) - Vitamin K - Biotin - Pantothenic Acid",

Estimated average requirement (EAR): The EAR is the average daily nutrient intake level estimated to meet the requirement of one-half of healthy individuals in a particular life stage and gender group. Recommended dietary allowance (RDA): The RDA is the average daily dietary intake level that is sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all individuals in a life stage and gender group. The RDA is calculated based on EAR and is set above the EAR to provide a margin of safety for most individuals. So, RDA is set 2SDs above the EAR.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "This patient with difficulty in dark vision and gritty sensations in the eye with findings of soft corneas suggests vitamin A deficiency. In the retina, a form of vitamin A called retinal (11-cis retinaldehyde) plays an important role in Wald's visual cycle. Its deficiency leads to vision defects. Rhodopsin, the visual pigment of the rod cells in the retina, consists of 11-cis retinal specifically bound to the protein opsin. When rhodopsin is exposed to light, a series of photochemical isomerizations occurs. This results in the bleaching of the visual pigment and release of all-trans-retinal and opsin. This process triggers a nerve impulse that is transmitted by the optic nerve to the brain.",

      "question": "A young woman presents with a 2-week history of progressive severe headache and blurry vision. Examination showed bilateral papilledema. A lumbar puncture revealed elevated opening pressure with normal CSF composition, and no space-occupying lesions were seen on MRI. She has recently started taking high-dose vitamin supplements. Which vitamin excess is likely to cause the above scenario?",

      "explanation": "The clinical scenario of increased intracranial pressure in the absence of a space-occupying lesion points towards the diagnosis of pseudotumor cerebri. Vitamin A excess is the likely cause. Clinical features of hypervitaminosis A: • CNS: Symptoms of raised intracranial pressure (pseudotumor cerebri) such as headache, nausea, vomiting, blurring of vision, ataxia, and anorexia. • Liver: Hepatomegaly and hyperlipidemia. • Musculoskeletal: Thickening of the long bones (bony exostosis), hypercalcemia, soft tissue calcification. • Dermatological: Dryness, exfoliative dermatitis, alopecia. • Teratogenesis: Pregnant women should not ingest excessive quantities as it can cause congenital malformations in the developing fetus. Isotretinoin (13-cis retinoic acid) is a drug that is teratogenic and absolutely contraindicated in pregnancy.",

      "explanation": "The clinical scenario is suggestive of vitamin A toxicity. Polar bear livers should not be consumed as they can cause vitamin A toxicity and death. Vitamin A and other fat-soluble vitamins are stored particularly in the liver and adipose tissue. Vitamins can be broadly classified into two categories: Fat-soluble vitamins: Vitamins A, D, E, K, Water-soluble vitamins: Vitamin B complex and vitamin C. Properties of fat-soluble vitamins: Hydrophobic in nature, Transported in blood by the lipoproteins, such as chylomicrons, Stored in the liver and the adipose tissue.",

      "explanation": "The clinical scenario is suggestive of vitamin A toxicity. It causes increased intracranial pressure, not reduced intracranial pressure. In cases of chronic ingestion, the accumulation of vitamin A goes beyond the capacity of intracellular binding proteins producing hypervitaminosis. Clinical features of hypervitaminosis A: • CNS: Symptoms of raised intracranial pressure (pseudotumor cerebri) such as headache, nausea, vomiting, blurring of vision, ataxia, anorexia • Liver: Hepatomegaly and hyperlipidemia • Musculoskeletal: Thickening of the long bones (bony exostosis), hypercalcemia, soft tissue calcification • Dermatological: Dryness, exfoliative dermatitis, alopecia • Teratogenesis: Pregnant women should not ingest excessive quantities as it can cause congenital malformations in the developing fetus.

Functions of vitamin D: • Regulation of calcium and phosphate: It increases blood calcium and phosphate levels. • Immunomodulatory action: Vitamin D increases the ability of the innate immune system to fight against pathogens. • Antiproliferative: Because of the antiproliferative function, deficiency (<20ng/ml) is associated with an increased incidence of colon cancer, breast cancer, and prostate cancer. • Bone development.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The first hydroxylation of vitamin D takes place in the liver to form 25-hydroxycholecalciferol. Vitamin D, as either cholecalciferol or ergocalciferol, does not have significant biological activity. It is activated in the following steps: \n   • Skin: 7-Dehydrocholesterol (an intermediate in the synthesis of cholesterol in the skin) undergoes a nonenzymic reaction on exposure to ultraviolet light (290nm to 315nm), yielding cholecalciferol.\n   • Liver: Cholecalciferol is hydroxylated to 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (the most abundant circulatory form of Vitamin D) by the enzyme 25-hydroxylase.\n   • Kidney: 25-hydroxycholecalciferol is converted to 1,25 dihydroxycholecalciferol (calcitriol), the biologically active form, by the enzyme 1α-hydroxylase.\n   Other metabolites: 24-Hydroxylase, 7-Dehydrocholesterol, Previtamin D3, Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol).\n   LIVER\n   SKIN\n   Sunlight\n   25-Hydroxylase\n   N\n   25-Hydroxycholecalciferol\n   KIDNEY\n   24,25-Dihydroxycholecalciferol\n   1α-Hydroxylase\n   1,25-Dihydroxycholecalciferol\n   Various steps in formation and hydroxylation of Vitamin D3\n   BONE MARROW\n   Calcitriol acts on the bone, intestine, and kidney to maintain calcium and phosphate homeostasis. If the body does not require vitamin D, in the kidney, 24-hydroxylase converts vitamin D into 24,25 dihydroxycholecalciferol, which is an inactive metabolite.",

      "explanation": "Warfarin, which is an oral anticoagulant drug, inhibits gamma-carboxylation of clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X, but not factor VIII. Thus, the levels of clotting factor VIII will be unaffected in her. Warfarin inhibits vitamin K epoxide reductase, an enzyme required for the reduction of vitamin K. Reduced vitamin K is involved in the post-translational modification of blood clotting factors such as prothrombin (factor II), factor VII, factor IX, factor X, protein C, and protein S. Therefore, warfarin indirectly inhibits the gamma-carboxylation reaction or post-translational modification of blood clotting factors.",
