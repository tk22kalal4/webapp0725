The most important sourceof NADPH is the hexose monophosphate shunt (HMP) pathway.The HMP shunt pathway, or pentose phosphate pathway, is an alternative route for themetabolism of glucose. It generates NADPH and synthesizes ribose. NADP+ is hydrogenated toNADPH by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Since the HMP shunt pathway and de novo fattyacid synthesis both occur in the cytosol of the cell, there are no membranes or permeabilitybarriers against the transfer of NADPH. Thus, this forms the major source for NADPH for fattyacid synthesis.Other minor sources of NADPH are extramitochondrial isocitrate dehydrogenase and NADPmalate dehydrogenase (malic enzyme).",

In the well fed state, there is an abundant supply of glucose, which is converted topyruvate, which in turn is converted to acetyl CoA. Acetyl CoA is diverted into fatty acid synthesis,in which acetyl CoA carboxylase is the rate-limiting enzyme. There is also a high insulin : glucagonratio in the well fed state. This favors dephosphorylation (activation) of acetyl CoA carboxylase,resulting in increased fatty acid synthesis. The fatty acids thus formed (most commonly palmitoylCoA) are esterified into triacylglycerols. This process is called lipogenesis.Note: The enzymes acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, thiolase, and carnitine palmitoyl transferase-I areinvolved in fatty acid oxidation and are inactive in the well-fed state.",

      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "Malonyl-CoA is the most active donor of two carbon atoms in fatty acid synthesis.Malonyl-CoA is a 3-carbon unit that donates 2 carbon units in fatty acid synthesis. It is formedfrom acetyl-CoA by acetyl-CoA carboxylase. During fatty acid synthesis, acetyl CoA primarily actsas the primer. The enzyme fatty acid synthase (FAS) adds two carbons from malonyl-CoA to theinital acetyl-CoA, forming a 4-carbon intermediate (butyryl-ACP). FAS then sequentially adds twocarbons from malonyl-CoA to the ACP-intermediates (eg: butyryl-ACP) to elongate the fatty acidchain.Thus, in the end product palmitic acid (C16), only carbon atoms 15 and 16 are from acetyl CoA.The remaining 14 carbon atoms are derived from malonyl-CoA. Thus, malonyl-CoA is the mostactive donor of two carbon atoms in fatty acid synthesis.Note:Option 3: Fatty acid synthesis is not a simple reversal of oxidation of fatty acids. These twoprocesses involve completely different enzymes and occur in different compartments of the cell.Option 4: Intermediates in fatty acid synthesis are covalently linked to the sulfhydryl group ofan acyl carrier protein (ACP), not coenzyme A, of the enzyme fatty acid synthase. Intermediates inthe fatty acid breakdown are covalently attached to the sulfhydryl group of coenzyme A.",

Eicosanoid synthesis is governed by the rate of release of arachidonic acid from membrane lipids in response to appropriate stimuli (e.g., increased calcium).

      "explanation": "Aspirin is least likely to decrease the production of leukotrienes. Aspirin is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that inhibits the cyclooxygenase (COX) pathway.

Leukotrienes, however, are produced by the lipoxygenase pathway (LOX), which is not inhibited by aspirin. Steroids, prostaglandin synthesis: cell membrane phospholipids, phospholipase C, phospholipase A2. COX1 and COX2 inhibitors, such as aspirin, indomethacin, inhibit PGH synthase (cyclooxygenase COX 1 and COX2, peroxidase). Other lipoxygenases, such as 5-lipoxygenase (ALOX5), produce HPETE (hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid), which is then converted to leukotriene A4 by 12-lipoxygenase. Lipoxin A4 and lipoxin B4 inhibit inflammation and chemotaxis. Leukotriene A4 will be converted to leukotriene C4 by glutathione-S-transferase, then to leukotriene D4 and leukotriene E4.
