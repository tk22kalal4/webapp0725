CPT-1 is responsible for transferring the acyl group from CoA to carnitine, forming acylcarnitine, which can enter the outer mitochondrial membrane. Thus, the acyl group enters the mitochondria from the cytoplasm. Malonyl CoA is an inhibitor of CPT-1. Thus, in the fed state, with a high insulin:glucagon ratio, acetyl CoA carboxylase is active and malonyl CoA is produced, which inhibits beta-oxidation. In the fasting state, with a low insulin:glucagon ratio, acetyl CoA carboxylase is inactive and malonyl CoA is not produced. Hence, beta-oxidation takes place.",

On the other hand, each cycle ofbeta-oxidation also produces 1 FADH2 and 1 NADH generating 1.5 ATP and 2.5 ATP respectively.Therefore (N-1) cycles of beta-oxidation will produce (N-1) FADH2 and (N-1) NADH.The energetics of ẞ-oxidation of a straight-chain fatty acid comprising of 2N carbon atoms can besummarized as follows:So, the net ATP yield after beta-oxidation of a straight-chain fatty acid having 2N carbon atomswill be (14N-4) - 2 = (14N- 6)We must keep in mind that during the initial activation of fatty acids(conversion of fatty acid to fatty acyl CoA), 2 ATP is utilized.This formula can be used to calculate net ATP yield from a straight-chain fatty acid having an evennumber of carbon atoms. For example,Net ATP yield from beta-oxidation of palmitic acid (16 carbon) will be 106.204Calculation: Here, 2N = 16 i.e, N = 8.

      "options": {
        "A": "Glycogenesis in muscle",
        "B": "Increased protein synthesis",
        "C": "Increased conversion of fatty acids to acetyl-CoA",
        "D": "Decreased cholesterol synthesis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "With the background of inadequately treated type I diabetes mellitus, an insulin-deficient state inthe body is expected which will lead to increased conversion of fatty acids to acetyl-CoA.Type 1 diabetes mellitus is commonly found in the adolescent population. In response to certainprecipitating factors, such patients may develop a severe insulin-deficient state. Since insulin is aninhibitor of hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), an insulin-deficient state will cause HSL overactivityin adipocytes and the breakdown of lipid into fatty acids (lipolysis). Free fatty acids will undergobeta-oxidation and produce a large amount of acetyl CoA, which gets converted to ketone bodies (acetoacetate, acetone, beta-hydroxybutyrate, etc.)",

        "D": "1 and 2 only"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "2, 3, and 4 statements correctly explain the reason behind increased ketogenesis as seen in type 1 DM. Type 1 DM is characterized by a deficiency in insulin production. Since insulin is deficient, GLUT4 (insulin-dependent uptake) mediated glucose uptake is not possible in the heart or skeletal muscles. So, adipose tissue mobilizes fat to be used as an energy source. These FFA (free fatty acids) are oxidized to acetoacetyl CoA, which serves as a precursor for ketone body synthesis. As the level of serum FFA is raised, proportionately more of the acetyl-CoA produced from their breakdown is converted to ketone bodies and less is oxidized via the citric acid cycle to CO2. A fall in the concentration of oxaloacetate, particularly within the mitochondria, can impair the ability of the citric acid cycle to metabolize acetyl-CoA and divert fatty acid oxidation toward ketogenesis. Such a fall may occur because of an increase in the (NADH)/(NAD+) ratio caused when increased beta-oxidation alters the equilibrium between oxaloacetate and malate so that the concentration of oxaloacetate is decreased. Beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase is one of the enzymes used in ketone body synthesis. Increased rate of ketone body synthesis in the insulin-deficient state implies an increased activity of beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase enzyme.",
