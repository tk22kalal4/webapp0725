      "explanation": "D-mannose and L-mannose are enantiomers. Enantiomers are mirror images of each other.The designation of a sugar isomer as the D- or L- form is determined by its spatial relationship tothe parent compound of the carbohydrates, that is, the three-carbon sugar glyceraldehyde. Theorientation of the -H and -OH groups around the penultimate carbon atom determines whetherthe sugar belongs to the D- or L- series. When the -OH group on the penultimate carbon atom ofthe sugar is on the right side, then the sugar is designated as a D- isomer. When the -OH group ison the left, it is an L-isomer.Naturally occurring monosaccharides are D-sugars and naturally occurring aminoacids are L-isomers. Racemase enzyme interconverts between D and L isomers.Examples of enantiomers include D-glucose and L-glucose, D-fructose and L-fructose andD-mannose and L-mannose11HHHOHHOHHOHHOHRRHOHHOHHOHHOHCH₂OHCH₂OHD-MannoseOMARROWL-Mannose",

Proteoglycans are components of the ground substance of connective tissue. Proteoglycans have a bottle brush appearance.
