      "explanation": "Linoleic acid is not an example of monounsaturated fatty acid. It is a polyunsaturated fatty acid(PUFA) with 2 double bonds.Monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) contain a single double bond. Examples include palmitoleicacid (@7), oleic acid (09) and elaidic acid (09).Clinical correlate: When substituted for saturated fatty acids in the diet, MUFAs lower both totaland LDL cholesterol and increase HDL. This may explain why the Mediterranean diet isassociated with decreased serum total and LDL cholesterol compared to a typical Western diethigh in saturated fats.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Omega 3 (03) fatty acids have anti-inflammatory effects. Omega 3 fatty acids, such as linolenic, eicosapentaenoic, and docosahexaenoic acids, result in the synthesis of less inflammatory prostaglandins and leukotrienes. This contributes to their anti-inflammatory effect. They also have anti-thrombotic effects. This is because thromboxane A3 (formed from Omega 3 fatty acids) is less thrombogenic than thromboxane A2 (formed from Omega 6 fatty acids). Omega 3 fatty acids have also been shown to reduce serum triglyceride levels.",

      "explanation": "Linoleic acid and α-linolenic acid are essential fatty acids.Essential fatty acids refer to polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) required for biological processeswhich are not synthesized by the body. Thus, they must be acquired from diet. The two essentialfatty acids in humans are linoleic acid (Omega 6) - the precursor of arachidonic acid -and α-Linolenic acid (Omega 3) - the precursor of eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoicacid. Arachidonic acid and y-Linolenic acid are semi-essential fatty acids since they can be derivedfrom essential fatty acids.",

      "explanation": "Dry skin, scaly rash, hair loss and poor wound healing with malabsorption syndrome aresuggestive of essential fatty acid deficiency due to malabsorption. Linoleic acid is an essential fattyacid.192Essential fatty acids (Linoleic acid and α-Linolenic acid) are needed for many physiologicprocesses, including maintaining the integrity of skin and cell membranes. Deficiency of essentialfatty acid is a rarely seen clinical entity in healthy adults and children who consume a varied diet.However, it can occur in individuals with risk factors affecting fatty acid absorption, like cysticfibrosis, pancreatic insufficiency, inflammatory bowel disease, massive bowel resection andprolonged parenteral nutrition. Patients with essential fatty acids deficiency have loss of structuralintegrity of the cell membranes, leading to like scaly dermatitis, hair loss and poor wound healing.",

      "explanation": "Trans fatty acids are a by-product of the hydrogenation of vegetable oils.Trans fatty acids are isomers of cis fatty acids, the naturally occurring unsaturated fatty acids. Theconfiguration of groups in a trans fatty acid is such that the acyl chains are on the opposite side ofthe double bond. They are formed during the hydrogenation of vegetable oils and in theproduction of margarine.TRANS H₂ M...C=C...McTrans fatty acids raise the level of triglycerides, total and LDL cholesterol and also lower the levelof HDL. Hence their consumption is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.WHO recommends that the intake of trans fats should be less than 1% of the total energy intake.",

      "explanation": "Prostaglandins are derived from arachidonic acid.Prostaglandins (PG) are a group of physiologically active lipid compounds. They act as localhormones. They belong to the chemical group known as prostanoids, which is a subclass ofeicosanoids. They are synthesized from arachidonic acid through the cyclooxygenase (COX)pathway.193",

      },
      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "A young boy with muscle aches, hypotonia, poor exercise tolerance, myoglobinuria and elevatedcreatine kinase suggests a deficiency of carnitine.Carnitine is a key transporter needed for beta-oxidation of fatty acids. It binds to acyl-CoAs toform acylcarnitine. This helps in the transfer of fatty acids across the impermeable innermitochondrial membrane for beta-oxidation. Thus, carnitine deficiency results in impairedbeta-oxidation of fatty acids. There will be inadequate ATP production in response to increaseddemands (e.g. exercise) with excess fatty acid accumulation in muscle cells. This results in musclebreakdown.Patients with carnitine deficiency present with hypoglycemia, muscle aches, hypotonia and poorexercise tolerance (myopathy). They have high levels of serum creatine kinase. Treatment includescarnitine supplementation.",
