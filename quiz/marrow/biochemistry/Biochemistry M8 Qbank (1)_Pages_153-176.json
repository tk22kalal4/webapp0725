      "explanation": "Type III collagen is involved in wound healing.Collagen types I and III predominate in the skin and aponeurotic layers. In the early stages ofwound healing, type III collagen is synthesized. It is replaced by type I collagen as wound healingprogresses.The tensile strength of the healing wound is directly proportional to the amount and type ofcollagen present. During healing, as disorganized collagen is degraded and reformed, covalentcross-links are formed that enhance tensile strength. The maximum strength of the healed wounddepends upon the interconnection of collagen subunits. Approximately 80 percent of the originalstrength of the tissue is obtained by six weeks after surgery. Wounds slowly continue to getstronger but may never achieve 100 percent of their previous strength.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Lack of a specific lysosomal hydrolase for glycoproteins cause a group of very rare, autosomalrecessive genetic diseases called glycoprotein storage diseases (oligosaccharidoses).Lysosomal acid hydrolases are specific for the removal of the oligosaccharide chains ofglycoproteins. They are primarily exoenzymes that remove their respective groups in sequence inthe reverse order of their incorporation (\"last on, first off\"). When one acid hydrolase is deficient,there is accumulation of partially degraded glycoproteins in the lysosomes. This results inoligosaccharidoses.",

      "explanation": "Buphthalmos is not a feature of I-cell disease.I-cell disease is an inherited lysosomal storage disorder caused by a defect in the Golgi enzymeN-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase. This results in failure of the Golgi to phosphorylatemannose residues (↓mannose-6-phosphate) on glycoproteins. Hence, proteins are secretedextracellularly instead of being delivered to lysosomes.
