      "explanation": "The first step for the catabolism of triacylglycerol is hydrolysis. Triacylglycerols must be hydrolyzed by lipase to their constituent fatty acids and glycerol before further catabolism. Hydrolysis (lipolysis) occurs in adipose tissue with the release of free fatty acids into the plasma. Free fatty acids combine with albumin to reach various tissues, where they are oxidized to obtain energy or re-esterified.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "A preterm infant requiring resuscitation at birth with cyanosis and diffuse bilateral opacities on chest radiography is suggestive of infant respiratory distress syndrome. It is caused by a deficiency of dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine. Dipalmitoyl lecithin or dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) is a major component of lung surfactant. In DPPC, positions 1 and 2 on the glycerol are occupied by palmitate. Surfactant is secreted by the type 2 pneumocytes in the alveoli. It reduces surface tension at the air-liquid interface of the alveolus and increases compliance. Mature levels of surfactant are present after 35 weeks of gestation. Thus, preterm babies are at risk of surfactant deficiency, leading to infant respiratory distress syndrome. Lung maturity of the fetus can be assessed by determining the ratio of lecithin to sphingomyelin (L:S ratio) in the amniotic fluid. A ratio of >2 indicates maturity. Other options - Option 1: Phosphatidylethanolamine, also called cephalin, is found in the cell membranes of nervous tissue, particularly in the brain. Option 3: Diphosphatidyl glycerol, also called cardiolipin, is found in the inner membrane of mitochondria and plays a key role in apoptosis. Option 4: Phosphatidylinositol present in the cell membrane acts as a precursor of hormone secondary messengers and platelet-activating factor.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Metachromatic leucodystrophy occurs due to the deficiency of arylsulfatase A enzyme.Metachromatic leucodystrophy is an autosomal recessive disorder. Deficiency of arylsulfatase Aenzyme leads to accumulation of sulfated glycosphingolipids in white matter with subsequentdemyelination. Affected infants (infantile form) present with cognitive deterioration, muscleweakness, hypotonia, nystagmus, myoclonic seizures, optic atrophy and progressive paralysis.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Accumulation of ceramide is seen in Farber's disease.Farber's disease occurs due to deficiency of ceramidase, which catalyses the breakdown ofceramide to fatty acid and sphingosine. Affected children present with painful joint swelling andnodules, progressive joint deformity, hoarse cry and breathing difficulty, mental retardation andfailure to thrive.246",
