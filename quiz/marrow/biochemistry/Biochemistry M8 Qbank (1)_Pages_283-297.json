They are located mainly in the endoplasmic reticulum in the liver and intestine but are also found in the mitochondria in some tissues. It is involved in a series of enzymatic reactions known as the hydroxylase cycle. Together, cytochromes P450 and b5 are responsible for about 75% of the modification and degradation of drugs that occur in the body by hydroxylation, not decarboxylation. Mitochondrial cytochrome P450 systems are found in steroidogenic tissues such as the adrenal cortex, testis, ovary, and placenta and are concerned with the biosynthesis of steroid hormones from cholesterol by hydroxylation (Option C). Depending on the number of atoms of oxygen being added, there are two types of oxygenases (Options A and B): Mono oxygenases: incorporate one oxygen atom into a substrate. Dioxygenases: incorporate two oxygen atoms into a substrate.",
