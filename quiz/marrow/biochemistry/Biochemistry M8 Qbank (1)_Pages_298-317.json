      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The above reaction has 2nd order for the forward reaction and 1st order for the reverse reaction. The sum of the molar ratios of the reactants defines the kinetic order of the reaction. In the forward reaction, A + A → P, the sum of reactants is 2. Thus, Rate ∝ [A] [A] or Rate ∝ [A]². Therefore, the reaction is said to be second order with respect to reactant A. In the reverse reaction, P → 2A, the sum of reactants is 1. Thus, Rate ∝ [P]. Therefore, the reaction is said to be first order with respect to reactant P. Kinetic order of reactions: • Zero-order reaction: Rate is independent of the concentration of reactants. • First-order reaction: Rate is directly proportional to the concentration of one of the reactants. • Second-order reaction: In the simplest kind of 2nd order reaction, the rate is proportional to the square of the concentration of one reactant.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The plot of initial reaction velocity against substrate concentration is hyperbolic, not linear. For a typical enzyme, the velocity of a reaction has a hyperbolic relationship with the substrate concentration. As the substrate concentration increases, initial velocity (Vi) increases until it reaches a maximum value, Vmax. After Vmax is reached, further increase in the substrate concentration does not change reaction velocity. This is because the enzyme is saturated with the substrate. The Michaelis constant (Km) is the substrate concentration at which Vi is half the maximal velocity, i.e., Vmax/2. The Michaelis-Menten equation illustrates the relationship between Vi and substrate concentration [S] mathematically, i.e., Vi = Vmax × [S] / (Km + [S]).",

      "explanation": "The catalytic efficiency of an enzyme is expressed as Kcat/Km. Kcat is the rate constant, which is the limiting rate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction at saturation. It is given by Vmax divided by the number of active sites of the enzyme. Km is the Michaelis-Menten constant, which is defined as the substrate concentration at which the initial velocity (Vi) is half the maximum velocity (Vmax/2). For some enzymes, when a substrate (S) binds to the active site of the enzyme (E), and forms an enzyme-substrate complex (ES), the product is instantaneously formed. For such enzymes, the reaction of E+S → ES becomes the rate-limiting step. Its rate is determined by the rate of diffusion of the molecules in a solution. Hence, these enzymes are called diffusion-limited or catalytically perfect. Examples of the catalytically perfect enzymes, where the catalytic efficiency reaches the diffusion limit of 10^8-10^9 M^-1s^-1: • Triosephosphate isomerase • Carbonic anhydrase • Acetylcholinesterase • Adenosine deaminase",

      "question": "In a reaction, the substrate is available in a concentration that is 1000 times the Km value of the enzyme. After 9 minutes of reaction, 1% of substrate is converted to product (12 micrograms/ml).

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The time taken for the formation of the same amount of product is 27 minutes. In this reaction, the substrate concentration becomes 1000 times, i.e., much greater than the Km value. Thus, the rate of this reaction is equal to Vmax and is thus independent of the substrate concentration, i.e., it follows zero-order kinetics. Thus, doubling the substrate concentration does not change the velocity of the reaction, i.e., it remains as Vmax. No matter the substrate concentration, the rate of the reaction is directly proportional to the concentration of the enzyme. In this situation, the enzyme concentration becomes 1/3rd. Thus, the velocity of the reaction (Vmax) also becomes 1/3rd. This means that the time taken for the formation of the same amount of product will become tripled, i.e., 9 × 3 = 27 minutes.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Vmax remains constant in competitive inhibition. Competitive inhibition is when the inhibitor binds reversibly to the substrate-binding site and competes with the substrate for the active enzyme-binding site. This effect of competitive inhibition can be overcome by increasing the substrate concentration, by which maximum velocity can still be achieved. Therefore, Vmax (maximum velocity of the reaction) is unaltered in this type of inhibition. However, the concentration of the substrate required to achieve half of the maximum velocity is increased. Therefore, Km is increased in this condition. Reaction velocity (V). Competitive inhibition: Vmax (no inhibitor) = Vmax (with competitive inhibitor). The Lineweaver-Burk plot shows that for the competitive inhibitor, Vmax remains the same as for the normal enzyme, but Km increases.",

      "explanation": "Km remains constant in non-competitive inhibition. Non-competitive inhibition of enzymes occurs by the binding of inhibitors to enzymes in locations different from the active site. The inhibition is not overcome by increasing the concentration of the substrate. Thus, non-competitive inhibitors decrease the Vmax of the reaction. Non-competitive inhibitors do not resemble the substrate. Thus, they do not interfere with the binding of the substrate to the enzyme. Thus, Km of the enzyme does not change. Enzyme-Inhibitor binding site and substrate binding site are independent. The inhibitor and substrate bind independently of each other. Either or both may be bound at any time. Completing the reaction, however, depends on the enzyme undergoing a conformational change that is blocked by the inhibitor. With non-competitive inhibitor, Vmax is lower than for the normal enzyme, but Km remains the same.",

The above graph is called the 'Lineweaver-Burk plot' or 'double reciprocal' plot. 1/Vo (Vo - initial velocity) is plotted versus 1/[S] ([S] - substrate concentration) and a straight line is obtained. This plot can be used to calculate Km and Vmax as well as to determine the mechanism of action of enzyme inhibitors. The x-intercept represents -1/Km while the y-intercept represents 1/Vmax. In non-competitive inhibition, Vmax decreases (or 1/Vmax increases) but Km is unchanged. Hence the graphs of inhibited and uninhibited reactions have the same x-intercepts (converge at the same -1/Km) but different y-intercepts.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Allosterically regulated enzymes belong to either the K-series, V-series, or both. An allosteric modifier or effector binds to the allosteric site to induce a conformational change in the catalytic or active site. The kinetics of an allosteric effector does not follow Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Hence, allosterically activated enzymes can fall under the following categories: • K-series: The allosteric effector raises the Km of the enzyme without affecting Vmax, i.e., similar to competitive inhibition. • V-series: The allosteric effector lowers the Vmax without affecting Km, i.e., similar to non-competitive inhibition. • Both: Intermediate effects can also be seen. Option B: Allosteric modifier noncovalently binds to a site other than the active site (Allo=other, steric=space) and affects the catalysis. Option C: Induction and repression are methods of controlling the rate of enzyme synthesis, not regulation of activity. Option D: Allosteric modifier binds to the enzyme noncovalently.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The highest catalytic efficiency is seen when Km = 2 micromole and Kcat = 200 per sec. Catalytic efficiency is calculated as Kcat/Km, where Km is inversely proportional to the binding affinity of the enzyme and Kcat is the catalytic constant (Vmax divided by the total number of active sites of the enzyme present). Higher values of Kcat and lower values of Km give better catalytic efficiency. Catalytic efficiency can be used to compare the performance of two different enzymes in catalyzing a reaction. Step 1: Km of each option, after converting respective units to moles, will be 10, 2, 2, and 4 (each multiplied by 10^-6) moles. Step 2: The catalytic efficiency is calculated as Kcat/Km. On substituting the values in various options after converting to moles, the values come out to be 2, 25, 100, and 50 (each multiplied by 10^6) M^-1 s^-1. Some enzymes can be so efficient that they convert the substrate to product instantaneously. They are limited only by the rate at which substrate diffuses towards the enzyme in a solution. These are called diffusion-limited enzymes, and their catalytic efficiency is as high as 10^8 M^-1 s^-1.",
