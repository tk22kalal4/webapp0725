      "explanation": "The most likely diagnosis in the above case scenario is glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase(G6PD) deficiency.The clinical features are suggestive of an acute hemolytic reaction following the administration ofcotrimoxazole. A hemolytic attack starts with abrupt onset of malaise, weakness, and abdominalor lumbar pain. After an interval of several hours to 2-3 days, the patient develops jaundice andoften dark urine, due to hemoglobinuria.The peripheral smear shows characteristic \"bite cells\" or degmacytes or blister cells. In G6PDdeficiency uncontrolled oxidative stress causes hemoglobin to denature and form Heinz bodies.Bite cells result from the removal of Heinz bodies by macrophages in the spleen.Cotrimoxazole contains sulfamethoxazole which triggers a hemolytic reaction in persons withG6PD deficiency.Drugs that carry a risk of clinical hemolysis in persons with G6PD Deficiency:65DrugsAntimalarialsPrimaquineChloroquineDapsone/chlorproguanilSulphonamides/sulphone SulfamethoxazoleSulfasalazinSAntibacterial/antibioticsOtherseSulfisoxazoleCotrimoxazoleCiprofloxacinChloramphenicolNalidixic acidNorfloxacinNitrofurantoinNaphthaleneMethylene blueRasburicase",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "High levels of L-xylulose in urine point to a diagnosis of essential pentosuria. It is a benign condition caused due to a defect in the uronic acid pathway. Essential pentosuria has no clinical consequences. However, it can give false-positive results when urinary glucose is measured using alkaline copper reagents (Benedict's test). The lack of enzyme xylulose reductase of the uronic acid pathway leads to essential pentosuria. Affected individuals excrete large amounts of L-xylulose in urine. Xylulose being a reducing sugar gives Benedict's test positive. Bial's test is positive as xylulose is a pentose. Essential pentosuria is a part of Garrod's tetrad which includes: Pentosuria, Albinism, Cystinuria, Alkaptonuria.",

      "explanation": "Fructokinase is the first enzyme to act on fructose metabolism.Fructokinase in the liver, kidneys and intestine catalyzes the phosphorylation of fructose tofructose-1-phosphate. This enzyme does not act on glucose and, unlike glucokinase, its activity isnot affected by fasting or by insulin, which may explain why fructose is cleared from the blood ofdiabetic patients at a normal rate.Deficiency of fructokinase results in essential fructosuria.Metabolism of fructoseFructoseFructokinaseFructose 1 phosphateAldolase BDihydroxyacetoneEssentialfructosuriaHereditary fructoseintoleranceGlyceraldehydeKinaseGlyceraldehyde 3 phosphatePyruvatephosphatePhosphotrioseisomeraseARROWAcetyl CoATCA cycleIf body demand for ATP is lessFatty acid synthesisOMARROW+TAG",

Symptoms include:•Hepatomegaly• Jaundice•• Vomiting• Lethargy• Convulsions.• HypoglycemiaUrine-reducing sugar (Benedict's test) and tests for ketoses (Rapid Furfural and Seliwanoff's test)are positive.

Galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase deficiency leads toclassical galactosemia.It is an autosomal recessive disorder. Clinical features include:• Accumulation of galactose-1-phosphate in the liver causes liver damage &amp; leads tohepatomegaly, vomiting, convulsions.• Accumulation of galactose-1-phosphate depletes the liver of inorganic phosphate leading todiminished ATP synthesis which affects gluconeogenesis resulting in hypoglycemia.• Accumulation of galactose-1-phosphate in the nerves causes intellectual disability.• Accumulation of galactitol in the lens causes an oil-drop cataract.Urinary reducing sugar (Benedict's test) and the Mucic acid test are positive.Treatment is a galactose-free diet.The flowchart given below depicts galactose metabolism.69Metabolism of galactoseEpimeraseCUDP Glucose- UDP GalactoseGalactoseGalactokinaseGalactose 1phosphateGalactose 1 PO4uridyl transferase(GALT)Glucose 1phosphateNon classicalgalactosemiaLactoseComplexcarbohydrateOMARROWGalactosemia(non classical)Classicalgalactosemia70",
