      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The attachment of mRNA to the ribosome is mediated through the guanyl cap at the 5' end. Eukaryotic mRNAs have 7-methylguanosine caps at the 5' end and poly-A tails at the 3' end. The 7-methylguanosine caps (Guanyl caps) are necessary for: • Processing of primary transcripts to mRNA. • Mediating the attachment of mRNA to the ribosome for translation. • Protection of mRNA against nucleolytic attack by 5' exonucleases. Other options: Option A: AAUAAA is present at the 3' end, which is the polyadenylation sequence (poly-A tail). They help stabilize the mRNA, facilitate its exit from the nucleus, and aid in translation. After the mRNA enters the cytosol, the poly-A tail is gradually shortened. Option B: tRNA molecules serve as adapters for the translation of the information in the sequence of nucleotides of the mRNA into specific amino acids. Option D: Shine-Dalgarno sequence initiates translation in prokaryotes. Note: The guanyl cap and poly-A tail aid in attaching the mRNA to the ribosome for translation; however, it is initiated and mediated first through the Guanyl cap. The poly(A) tail stimulates recruitment of the 40S ribosomal subunit to the mRNA, after which the ribosomal subunit binds to the guanyl cap at the 5' end of mRNA.",

      "explanation": "After synthesis, eukaryotic RNA undergoes extensive post-transcriptional modifications, including 7-methylguanosine capping, polyadenylation forming a poly-A tail, and splicing. 5' Capping: This is the first of the processing reactions for pre-mRNA. The cap is a 7-methylguanosine attached backward to the 5'-terminal end of the mRNA, forming an unusual 5' to 5' triphosphate linkage. A poly-A tail is added after transcription by the nuclear enzyme polyadenylate polymerase, using ATP as the substrate. These tails help stabilize the mRNA, facilitate its exit from the nucleus, and aid in translation. The maturation of eukaryotic mRNA usually involves the removal of introns and the joining of exons together to form the mature mRNA. The process of removing introns and joining exons is called splicing. snRNA facilitates the removal of introns by forming base pairs with the consensus sequences at each end of the intron.",

Self-splicing introns fold into complex loops and undergo transesterification reactions, thus undergoing self-splicing. Other options: Option A: Split genes have the advantage that they allow alternative splicing so that a single gene can code for variant forms of the same protein. Option C: Beta-thalassemia results from the faulty splicing of the beta-globin transcript. However, the spliceosome is normal and the reason for the fault is a mutation in the beta-globin gene itself.

      "explanation": "The eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) that helps in cap binding is eIF 4. eIFs are accessory proteins that help initiate protein synthesis. Functions of eIF: \n   • eIF3 & eIF 1A: The first step of initiation involves dissociation of the ribosome into its 40S and 60S subunits. eIF3 & eIF 1A bind to the newly dissociated 40S ribosomal subunit and hence delay the association of 40S and 60S. \n   • eIF2: It is involved in the formation of a binary complex (GTP+eIF). This complex binds to Met-tRNA. Further, the GTP-eIF-2-tRNAi ternary complex binds to the 40S ribosomal subunit to form the 43S preinitiation complex. This is the second step of initiation. \n   • eIF4: It forms the cap-binding complex. It binds to the 5′ terminal of mRNA molecules, which are capped. The mRNA would then bind to the 43S preinitiation complex to form the 48S initiation complex, in the third step of initiation. \n   • eIF5: It is involved in the hydrolysis of GTP bound to eIF2. This results in the binding of the 60S subunit with the 48S initiation complex to form the 80S initiation complex. This is the fourth step of initiation. \n   Complex assembles on the 5′ cap structure. The complex scans mRNA to find the start codon.

This occurs by insertion of additional uracils at the 3' end of the mRNA and proceeds in 3' to 5' direction. RNA editing in apoB synthesis: In the liver, the apoB gene is transcribed to mRNA, which is then translated to apoB 100. In the intestine, the same apoB gene is transcribed to the same mRNA.

      "explanation": "Among the given options, using promoters W and Y will yield the desired product A. Promoters or DNA regulatory elements usually precede the desired exon to be transcribed. It helps redirect transcription of only the desired exons of a gene to yield a product. Alternative splicing utilizes different promoters to code slightly different products from the same gene. In this question, the desired product A has segments 1, 3, 4, 5, whilst the other product B has 1, 2, 4, 5. The difference between both is the presence of segment 3 in product A and the presence of segment 2 in product B. As the product in question is A, only segment 3 is required while excluding segment 2 and ensuring segments 1, 4, and 5 are intact. Segment 1 needs to be transcribed and so W is essential. Segment 2 does not need to be transcribed. Segment 3 needs to be transcribed and so Y is essential. Segment 4 needs to be transcribed, but Z is not essential as Y continues the transcription in the direction shown by the arrow. The answer is hence promoters W and Y.",
