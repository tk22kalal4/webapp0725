      "explanation": "Hyperchromicity at 260 nm is a feature of denatured DNA. Denaturation or melting of DNA is a process that separates the two strands into component strands. During denaturation, the hydrogen bonds are broken. The phosphodiester bond is not broken. DNA's secondary and tertiary structures are also broken, but the primary structure is not altered. As DNA gets denatured, its viscosity decreases. Denatured DNA also shows hyperchromicity at 260 nm, which is the increase in absorbance of UV light shown by nitrogenous bases.",

      "explanation": "H1 is not a histone found in nucleosomes. Chromatin is formed by nucleosomes, which are composed of DNA wound around an octameric complex of histone molecules. They contain four major types of histones: H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. Histones are a small family of closely related basic proteins composed of arginine and lysine. H3 and H4 form a tetramer while H2A and H2B form dimers; these histone oligomers associate to form the histone octamer. These four core histones are subject to at least six types of covalent modification or post-translational modifications - acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, ADP-ribosylation, monoubiquitylation, and sumoylation. H1 histone is seen in the linker region between nucleosomes and is bound loosely to the nucleosome. An octamer of core histones: H2A, H2B, H3, H4 (each one ×2), core DNA, histone H1, linker DNA.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Roles of modified histones: • Phosphorylation of histone H1 is associated with the condensation of chromosomes during the replication cycle. • Acetylation of H3 and H4 is associated with the activation or inactivation of gene transcription. • Acetylation of core histones is associated with chromosomal assembly during DNA replication. • Methylation of histones is correlated with activation and repression of gene transcription. • ADP-ribosylation of histones is associated with DNA repair. • Monoubiquitylation is associated with gene activation, repression, and heterochromatic gene silencing. Methylation and acetylation of histones: Gene - Histone tail - Histone - Methyl group - DNA inaccessible, gene inactive. Histone tail - Acetyl group - DNA accessible, gene active. Methylation of DNA and histones causes nucleosomes to pack tightly together. Transcription factors cannot bind the DNA, and genes are not expressed. Histone acetylation results in loose packing of nucleosomes. Transcription factors can bind the DNA and genes are expressed.",

      "explanation": "The true statement is that heterochromatin stains densely. Differences between heterochromatin and euchromatin: Heterochromatin - Transcriptionally inactive - Densely packed - Chromatin stains densely. The chromatin in the region is high in meC content (methylation of deoxycytidine residues decreases gene transcription). Histone deacetylation increases heterochromatin. Euchromatin - Transcriptionally active - Less densely packed - Chromatin stains less densely. Generally replicated earlier than heterochromatin. Histone acetylation increases euchromatin.",

The replication fork is formed when DNA helicase unwinds a short segment of the parent dsDNA. Primase initiates the synthesis of an RNA primer. DNA polymerase then initiates DNA synthesis (deoxynucleotide polymerization) in the 5' to 3' direction. Hence, helicase, primase, and polymerases act at the replication fork.",

      "explanation": "Unwinding of DNA is not a function of the DNA polymerase complex. A number of different DNA polymerase molecules engage in DNA replication that share three important properties: chain elongation, processivity, and proofreading. Unwinding of DNA is done by the enzyme helicase. Original (template) DNA, chromosome, free nucleotides, DNA polymerase, helicase, lagging strand, leading strand, replication fork, adenine, thymine, cytosine, guanine, DNA polymerase, and original (template) DNA strand.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Mismatch repair will be defective in a patient with multiple gastrointestinal polyps and carcinoma, with a positive family history/history of hereditary non-polyposis colon carcinoma (HNPCC). Mismatch repair is a DNA repair mechanism that corrects single-nucleotide mismatches, insertions, and deletions introduced by the DNA polymerase during DNA replication. HNPCC or Lynch syndrome is an autosomal dominant genetic condition. It occurs due to defects in DNA mismatch repair genes like MLH1 and MSH2. The genomes of these patients show microsatellite instability. HNPCC is associated with a high risk of colon cancer. It may also be associated with a risk of developing carcinomas of the endometrium, stomach, small bowel, ovary, pancreas, and transitional cell carcinoma of the ureter and renal pelvis. The diagnostic criteria for HNPCC are referred to as the Amsterdam criteria or the 3-2-1-0 rule. It includes: • Three or more relatives with HNPCC-associated cancer (colorectal cancer, endometrial cancer, cancer of the small bowel, ureter, or renal pelvis), one of whom is a first-degree relative of the other two. • At least two successive generations affected. • At least one case diagnosed before age 50 years. • Familial adenomatous polyposis excluded. • Tumors verified by pathologic examination. Other options: Option B: Patients with xeroderma pigmentosum have a defect in the nucleotide excision repair pathway. Option C: Defect in base excision repair pathway is seen in patients with MUTYH-associated polyposis. Option D: Sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia are examples of diseases seen in patients with point mutations.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Photosensitivity, freckling, and skin cancer on the face in a child are suggestive of xeroderma pigmentosum. It is an example of defective DNA nucleotide excision repair. In xeroderma pigmentosum, there is an inability to repair DNA pyrimidine dimers caused by UV exposure. It is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by exaggerated sunburns and pigmentary changes on exposure to UV radiations. There is increased risk of developing non-melanoma and melanoma skin cancers, and neurodegeneration. They are also more prone to developing smoking-induced lung cancers. Diagnosis is mainly clinical and it can be confirmed definitively by cellular tests for defective DNA repair. Management includes sun avoidance and regular follow-up to assess and treat any skin cancers. There is no cure for xeroderma pigmentosum.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "SCID is associated with a defective non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ). NHEJ is a predominant pathway for DNA double-stranded break repair. NHEJ also functions in class switch recombination, enhancing T and B cell diversity. Thus, NHEJ deficiency leads to combined immunodeficiency due to a failure to carry out recombination efficiently. Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is characterized by defects in both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. Genes involved are JAK3, RAG1, and IL-7R. Persons with SCID are extremely susceptible to recurrent, severe infections by a wide range of pathogens, including Candida albicans, Pneumocystis jirovecii, Pseudomonas species, cytomegalovirus, varicella, and a host of other bacteria. X-linked SCID is the most common form, accounting for 50% to 60% of cases, is X-linked, and hence, SCID is more common in boys. The genetic defect is a mutation in the common gamma-chain (γc) subunit of cytokine receptors. In these patients, the thymus contains lobules of undifferentiated epithelial cells, resembling fetal thymus. Autosomal recessive SCID is commonly caused by a deficiency of adenosine deaminase (ADA) enzyme. In these patients, the thymus contains remnants of Hassall's corpuscles.",

      "explanation": "Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) is the major mechanism used by CRISPR-Cas9 for gene repair. The CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) are clustered palindromic sequences found in many bacteria. It is a form of acquired immunity to infection by bacteriophages, which complements the system of restriction endonucleases and methylases. CRISPR uses RNA-based targeting to bring the Cas9 endonuclease to foreign (or any complementary) DNA. Within bacteria, this CRISPR-RNA-Cas9 complex then degrades and inactivates the targeted DNA. The CRISPR system has been adapted for use in eukaryotic cells for gene deletion, gene editing, and even modulation of gene transcription.",

In organ transplantation, chimeric DNA refers to the mixture of donor and recipient genetic material that occurs when donor cells begin functioning within the recipient's body. It is used for long-term monitoring of bone marrow transplant recipients. Detecting changes in the levels of donor-derived cells can provide early warning signs of graft failure, rejection, or relapse of underlying disease. Note: The practical applications of recombinant DNA technology include: Gene mapping using techniques such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Producing proteins such as interferons, tPA (tissue plasminogen activator), insulin, growth hormone, and the hepatitis B vaccine.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The false statement is that telomerase is involved in DNA repair. Telomeres are the ends of chromosomal DNA. Since prokaryotic DNA is circular, it does not have free ends and hence no telomeres. Thus, telomeres are present only in eukaryotes. Telomeres have TG-rich repeats and usually do not code for any proteins. With every DNA replication during cell division, telomere shortening occurs. Once telomeres are almost negligible or non-existent in length, the DNA is unable to replicate and the cell dies. Hence, there is a limit to the number of times a cell can divide. In stem cells and cancer cells, an enzyme, telomerase, having reverse transcriptase activity (RNA-dependent DNA polymerase), adds telomeres to the chromosome ends, thereby preserving chromosomal length. It allows the stem cells and cancer cells to multiply a lot more times than a normal adult cell.",
