      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Thiamine (Vitamin B1) deficiency makes a patient prone to lactic acidosis. Thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) serves as a coenzyme for the pyruvate dehydrogenase enzyme. In a state of thiamine deficiency, there is an impaired conversion of pyruvate to acetyl CoA. When the patient consumes a high carbohydrate diet, there is thus an accumulation of pyruvate. Pyruvate then gets converted into lactate by the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase. This results in increased plasma concentrations of lactate and pyruvate, leading to a state of lactic acidosis.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Decreased energy production is seen in thiamine deficiency because it acts as a coenzyme for pyruvate dehydrogenase and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. Both pyruvate dehydrogenase and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase are required for the production of NADH, which is used for ATP production. In thiamine deficiency, the reaction catalyzed by pyruvate dehydrogenase cannot go forward. Hence, there is no formation of acetyl CoA, causing decreased substrate for the citric acid cycle. As a result, energy (ATP) production is grossly reduced and instead, lactic acidosis is seen.",

      "explanation": "Cardiac failure (orthopnea and pedal edema) and cardiomegaly in a patient with chronic alcoholism suggest a diagnosis of wet beriberi. Thiamine (Vitamin B1) deficiency leads to this condition. Chronic alcohol consumption is associated with thiamine deficiency due to inadequate dietary intake, malabsorption of thiamine from the gastrointestinal tract, and impaired utilization of thiamine in the cells. This deficiency presents as: • Wet beriberi: The cardiovascular system is affected. Patients present with high output cardiac failure (orthopnea, pedal edema), dyspnea, cardiomegaly, and pulmonary edema. • Dry beriberi: Both the peripheral and central nervous systems are affected. Patients present with symmetric motor and sensory neuropathy (pain, paresthesia, loss of reflexes) especially in the lower limbs. In severe cases, muscle atrophy may also be seen.",

The current standard of treatment for patients with symptoms of Wernicke's encephalopathy is to give thiamine 100 mg intravenously before administering glucose-containing IV fluids. Thiamine deficiency leads to the following: • Wernicke's encephalopathy: It is more commonly seen in alcoholics with chronic thiamine deficiency. It is characterized by global confusion, truncal ataxia, ophthalmoplegia, and horizontal nystagmus. • Korsakoff psychosis: Symptoms in addition to those of Wernicke's encephalopathy include memory loss and confabulation. • Beriberi: It can be either - • Dry beriberi: Sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy, muscle weakness • Wet beriberi: Tachycardia, cardiomegaly, high-output cardiac failure",

      "explanation": "A patient with high intake of jowar and characteristic Casal's necklace pattern rash is most likely suffering from pellagra. It is caused due to a deficiency of vitamin B3, known as niacin. Pellagra, or niacin deficiency, presents with 3 classical Ds - dermatitis (photosensitive), diarrhea, and dementia. Patients often have the Casal collar or Casal necklace. It is a clinical sign in which there is an erythematous pigmented skin rash in the distribution of a broad collar (dermatomes C3 and C4). If left untreated, pellagra leads to the 4th D of death. Jowar (sorghum) has high leucine content. This inhibits QPRTase, an enzyme responsible for the synthesis of niacin from amino acid tryptophan. Excessive consumption of maize-based diets can also cause pellagra due to their low levels of niacin and tryptophan.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Loose stools, depression, beefy red tongue and Casal's necklace, as seen in the image, is suggestive of pellagra. Pellagra-like symptoms are not seen in Wernicke's encephalopathy. Pellagra is caused by niacin deficiency, either due to dietary deficiency or deficient conversion of tryptophan to niacin. Hence, pellagra-like symptoms are seen in: Hartnup disease: It is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the SLC6A19 gene leading to defective membrane transport of tryptophan across PCT (kidney) and enterocytes (intestine). This leads to malabsorption, and hence deficiency of tryptophan. Carcinoid syndrome: Due to excess conversion of tryptophan to serotonin, there is a decreased level of tryptophan available for niacin synthesis. Pyridoxine deficiency: Pyridoxine is required as the co-factor of kynureninase, an enzyme in the pathway of niacin synthesis. Maize/corn rich diet: In these grains, niacin is in bound form (niacytin form) and is not absorbed. Jowar diet (Sorghum): The increased leucine content inhibits QPRTase enzyme, an enzyme in the pathway of niacin synthesis.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Niacin should be used cautiously in diabetics as it can cause hyperglycemia. Niacin induces insulin resistance and also decreases glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, which may result in severe hyperglycemia. When niacin is prescribed for patients with known or suspected diabetes, blood glucose levels should be monitored at least once a week.",

        "D": "Ask for diarrhea and conjunctivitis"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "An alcoholic patient with a red-colored beefy tongue, itching, and the characteristic Casal's necklace, shown in the image, is suggestive of pellagra. It is caused by niacin/vitamin B3 deficiency. Hence, one should ask for a history of diarrhea and memory loss in this case. Pellagra presents with 4 Ds: Diarrhea, Dermatitis, Dementia, and if untreated, Death. Early symptoms of pellagra are loss of appetite, generalized weakness and irritability, abdominal pain, and vomiting. Photosensitive dermatitis is seen over sun-exposed areas. Diarrhea occurs due to proctitis or malabsorption. Bright red glossitis (beefy tongue) and Casal's necklace (a pigmented, scaly skin rash that forms a ring around the neck) follow. Depressive psychosis and dementia also commonly occur. Corn/maize/jowar-based diets are the main causes of niacin deficiency. Corn/maize lacks niacin and tryptophan. The excess leucine in jowar and maize disrupts the conversion of tryptophan to niacin. Niacin deficiency is also seen in alcoholism. Hence, additional histories of diarrhea and memory loss will aid in supporting the diagnosis of pellagra (along with dietary history). Treatment includes oral supplementation with 100-200 mg of nicotinamide or nicotinic acid three times daily for 5 days. Option B: Thiamine deficiency (vitamin B1) features include CVS manifestations like heart failure and edema (wet beriberi), peripheral neuritis (dry beriberi), and Wernicke encephalopathy (in alcoholics). Option C: Dermatitis seen in pellagra is due to dietary deficiency of niacin and so allergy history is not relevant. Option D: Conjunctivitis is not a feature of niacin deficiency.",

      "explanation": "A man with hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, elevated LDL and VLDL should be treated with a lipid-lowering agent. Thus, the vitamin that can be used to treat this patient is nicotinic acid (niacin or vitamin B3). Niacin causes a reduction in LDL, VLDL, and triglycerides along with increasing HDL. It is the only lipid-lowering agent that lowers lipoprotein (a) levels significantly. The main adverse effect of niacin is cutaneous flushing and pruritus.

        "D": "It reduces the level of LDL"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Niacin increases the level of HDL. Niacin (vitamin B3) is known to inhibit lipolysis within the adipose tissue. Hence, the circulating free fatty acids (FFAs) are reduced. The liver normally uses these circulating FFAs as a precursor in the synthesis of triacylglycerol (TAG). As a result, niacin causes a reduction in liver TAG synthesis. TAGs are in turn required for very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) synthesis. Therefore, both plasma VLDL and LDL values are reduced. Overall, niacin decreases LDL, VLDL, and TAG levels, and increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels. Thus, it is particularly useful in the treatment of type IIb hyperlipoproteinemia, in which both VLDL and LDL are elevated.",
