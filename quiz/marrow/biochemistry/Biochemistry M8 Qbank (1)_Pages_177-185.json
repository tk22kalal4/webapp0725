      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "This child with vomiting, lethargy, and irritability with an X-linked recessive urea cycle disordermost likely hyperammonemia type IIHyperammonemia type II is due to the deficiency of the enzyme ornithine transcarbamoylase. Itis the most frequent urea cycle defect. Biochemical findings include elevated levels of glutamine inthe blood, urine, CSF, low citrulline, and high urinary orotic acid. This condition may beprecipitated by a switch from formula to whole milk.Urea cycle disorders are all characterized by hyperammonemia, encephalopathy, and respiratoryalkalosis. There is an accumulation of the precursors of urea - ammonia, and glutamine. Theyinclude:• Defect in carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I - Hyperammonemia type 1• Defect in ornithine transcarbamoylase - Hyperammonemia type 2•• Defect in argininosuccinate synthetase - Citrullinemia• Defect in argininosuccinate lyase- Argininosuccinic aciduria• Defect in the gene for arginase- HyperargininemiaClinical features of urea cycle disorders are common to all and include vomiting, avoidance ofhigh-protein foods, intermittent ataxia, irritability, lethargy, and severe mental retardation.Note: Classically, Type 2 Hyperammonemia is an X-linked recessive disorder. But in certainheterozygous females (with one mutated gene), the disease manifests and they necessarily do notremain as carriers. In them, the disease follows an X-linked partially dominant pattern ofinheritance.",

      "correct_answer": "",
      "explanation": "This infant with failure to thrive, hypoglycemia, elevated levels of glutamine and uracil levels mostlikely has hyperammonemia type 2. This condition occurs due to the deficiency of the enzymeornithine transcarbamoylase.There is an accumulation of carbamoyl phosphate, which then enters into pyrimidinesynthesis producing orotic acid and uracil and leading to orotic aciduria and high uracil in bloodand urine. Since the ammonia from glutamine is not converted into urea, its level increases.Glutamate is not regenerated. Since glutamate is not available for transamination, amino acids182cannot be used for gluconeogenesis. Hence, the glucose level drops in the blood.•Treatment:Reducing intake of ammonia - Dietary protein, a metabolic source of ammonium, is restrictedand caloric intake is provided by glucose and fat.• Increasing excretion of ammonia - Addition of phenylbutyrate, which scavenges nitrogen bycombining with amino acids to form a more water-soluble product. This can be easily excreted bythe kidneys.",
