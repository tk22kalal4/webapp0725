      "explanation": "Mature erythrocyte is not a site for heme biosynthesis.Approximately 85% of heme synthesis occurs in erythroid precursor cells in the bone marrow andthe majority of the remainder in hepatocytes. Heme biosynthesis occurs both in mitochondria andcytoplasm. It is initiated by the condensation of succinyl-CoA and glycine in a reaction catalyzedby mitochondrial ALA synthase. This initial reaction, and the last three steps in the formation ofheme occur in mitochondria, whereas the intermediate steps of the biosynthetic pathway occur inthe cytosol.Heme biosynthesisMitochondriaGlycineSuccinyl-CoAFeedbackinhibitionPLPALAsynthase6-ALAHemeFerrochelataseFe2+Protoporphyrin-IXProtoporphyrinogenoxidaseProtoporphyrinogen-IXCoproporphyrinogenoxidaseCoproporphyrinogen-IIICytosol8-Aminolevulinic acid(ALA)2xALA-dehydratasePorphobilinogen (PBG)4x4 NH3Uroporphyrinogen-IsynthaseHydroxymethylbilane(linear tetrapyrrol)Uroporphyrinogen-IIIsynthaseSpontaneousUroporphyrinogen-III Uroporphyrinogen-IUroporphyrinogendecarboxylaseCO2-Coproporphyrinogen-IIIMARROW",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "A child with acute abdominal pain, tingling sensation, and weakness of limbs with a history of eating paint likely has lead poisoning. It is characterized by impaired ALA dehydratase enzyme activity. Lead is a potent inhibitor of both ALA dehydratase and ferrochelatase/heme synthase (option C). However, it has the greatest inhibitory action on ALA dehydratase. Lead poisoning thus leads to the buildup of protoporphyrin and ALA. Lead also substitutes for calcium in many fundamental cellular processes. It can cross red blood cell membranes as well as the blood-brain barrier and enter the neuroglial cells, which support brain function. The fatal dose of lead is 20g of lead acetate, and the fatal period is 1 to 2 days. Lead poisoning.

      "question": "An adult male patient presents with yellow discoloration of the sclera. There was a history of recurrent mild jaundice since childhood. His lab values are mentioned below. A liver biopsy was performed which revealed normal liver architecture with coarse granular black pigmentation. The mutation of which protein is involved in the following condition?",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Yellow discoloration of the sclera with coarse granular black pigmentation of the liver is suggestive of Dubin-Johnson syndrome, characterized by a mutation in the MRP-2 protein. Dubin-Johnson syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder with predominantly conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. It is due to a defect in the active transport of bilirubin across the canalicular membrane, due to a mutation in the MRP-2 protein. It is also known as black liver jaundice due to the accumulation of a dark pigment, derived from epinephrine metabolites, in the lysosomes of centrilobular hepatocytes. Bromosulfphalein test on plasma shows 2 peaks. Option A: OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 are mutated in Rotor syndrome. It is due to defective bilirubin excretion and causes conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Option B: BSEP protein is mutated in progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC type-2) and benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis (BRIC-2). Option C: MRP-3 is mutated in PFIC type-3.

        "D": "Missense mutation of transferase enzyme is the most common cause"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "A young adult with a short history of jaundice following a period of stress (viral fever) withunconjugated hyperbilirubinemia likely has Gilbert syndrome. Gilbert syndrome most commonlyoccurs due to promoter defect of the UGT1A1 enzyme.Gilbert syndrome is caused by a defect in the promoter region of the gene coding for theUDP-glucuronosyl transferase (UGT1A1) enzyme. This results in a variable rate of transcription ofthe normal enzyme. UGT1A1 activity is reduced to 10-33% of normal. It presents with periods ofmild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia with other liver function tests being normal. The disorderis precipitated by stress, alcohol and reduced caloric intake.281Liver histology shows increased lipofuscin pigment. It responds well to phenobarbitone. Gilbert'ssyndrome doesn't require treatment. The bilirubin levels may fluctuate over time, and patientsmay occasionally have jaundice, which usually resolves on its own with no ill effects.BloodBilirubin metabolismBilirubinAlbuminUDPglucuronateHepatocyteBilecanaliculiUDPOATPRotor syndromeElucuroniacidGlucuronyltransferaseCrigler-Najjar,syndrome I and IIGilbert syndrome.Bilirubin diglucuronideMRP2OMARROWDubin-JohnsonsyndromeIntestine",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Urine urobilinogen is not increased in obstructive jaundice. Obstructive jaundice has the following features: \n      • Absent urinary urobilinogen: In complete obstruction of the biliary tree, conjugated bilirubin cannot enter the intestine. Thus, it is not metabolized by the intestinal flora and urobilinogen is not formed.\n      • Increased serum direct bilirubin: Due to obstruction in the biliary tree, the bilirubin conjugates diffuse into the blood causing conjugated hyperbilirubinemia.\n      • Increased urine bilirubin: Conjugated bilirubin is water-soluble and thus appears in the urine in excess amounts.\n      Option A: Urine bilirubin is absent in hemolytic jaundice because unconjugated bilirubin is not water-soluble.\n      Option C: Crigler-Najjar syndrome, due to absent UGT1A1 activity, presents with raised unconjugated bilirubin.\n      Option D: Hepatocellular jaundice can have decreased urine urobilinogen if micro-obstruction occurs due to swollen, damaged hepatocytes.",
