      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Vitamin B12 contains corrin rings with cobalt as a part of its structure, hence this group of vitamins are referred to as cobalamins. Vitamin B12 is derived mainly from animal products such as meat, fish, eggs, and fortified cereals. There are no plant sources as such for vitamin B12 / cobalamine, hence strict vegetarians are at risk of developing a nutritional deficiency of vitamin B12. Vitamin B12 deficiency is associated with defects in RBC production leading to megaloblastic anemia.",

        "A": "A 40-year-old male with a segmental resection of primary duodenal cancer",
        "B": "An intestinal obstruction case with jejunectomy due to a necrotic segment",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "A 30-year-old patient who had his ileum removed due to Crohn's disease is likely to develop a vitamin B12 deficiency. Vitamin B12 is absorbed from the distal third of the ileum via receptors known as cubulin, which binds the intrinsic factor-vitamin B12 complex. Dietary vitamin B12 is normally bound to proteins in food. Pepsin and gastric acid in the stomach degrade these food proteins and release vitamin B12. The free vitamin B12 then binds to a salivary glycoprotein called haptocorrin (R-binder). In the alkaline pH of the duodenum, pancreatic proteases degrade the haptocorrin, and vitamin B12 is released again. It then binds tightly to intrinsic factor (IF), a glycoprotein secreted by the parietal cells of the stomach; this binding takes place in the duodenum. The IF-vitamin B12 complex reaches the terminal ileum and attaches to a receptor on the enterocyte, from where it is absorbed. Vitamin B12 is transported in the blood bound to a carrier protein called transcobalamin II and delivered to the peripheral tissues. Absorption sites: Iron - Duodenum; Folate - Jejunum; Vit B12 - Ileum. Absorption of vitamin B12: Proteins - Vitamin B - Dietary intake. Duodenum - Proteases - Ileum - Pancreas - Salivary gland - R-Protein - Gastric parietal cells - Pepsin - R-B₁ complex - Splitting of R-B complex - Ileal cell - Blood - Portal vein - Transcobalamin II - Bone marrow - Intrinsic factor - IF-B complex",

      "question": "A 45-year-old patient came with complaints of easy fatigability and palpitations. On examination, she had pallor. Methylmalonic acid excretion in the urine was estimated as a part of evaluation. This can be utilized to assess the nutritional status of which vitamin?",

        "C": "Niacin",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The above scenario suggests anemia and methylmalonic acid excretion in the urine can be utilized to assess the nutritional status of Vitamin B12. Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase is a Vitamin B12-dependent enzyme. The activity of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase is greatly reduced in Vitamin B12 deficiency, leading to an accumulation of methylmalonic acid and its excretion in urine. There are two Vitamin B12-dependent enzymes: Methionine synthase (homocysteine methyltransferase): catalyzes the conversion of homocysteine to methionine; Methylmalonyl CoA mutase: methylmalonyl CoA, formed as an intermediate in the catabolism of valine, isoleucine, and propionyl CoA, is converted to succinyl CoA. Note: Urinary excretion of methylmalonic acid is also used to differentiate between megaloblastic anemia due to folate and Vitamin B12 deficiency.",

        "C": "Niacin",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Folate trap occurs in the deficiency of vitamin B12. Methionine-S-adenosylmethionine-Methionine-Folate Cycle: Folate-Tetrahydrofolate-Serine-Glycine-S-adenosylhomocysteine-Methionine synthase (vitamin B12)-5,10 methylenetetrahydrofolate-Homocysteine-Serine-5 methyltetrahydrofolate-Cystathionine-β synthase (vitamin B6)-Cystathionine-Cysteine. The conversion of 5,10-methylene-THF into 5-methyl-THF (methyltetrahydrofolate) is an irreversible process. The major source of tetrahydrofolate for tissues is 5-methyl-THF. The only way to make further use of 5-methyl-THF and to maintain the folate cycle is by the vitamin B12-dependent remethylation of homocysteine to methionine by methionine synthase enzyme. Decreased activity of methionine synthase in vitamin B12 deficiency results in the accumulation of methyltetrahydrofolate that cannot be used, resulting in a folate trap. The folate cycle provides a link between the functions of folate and vitamin B12, where vitamin B12 deficiency causes a functional deficiency of folate.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The clinical scenario of a patient on a vegan diet now presenting with glossitis of the tongue, hyperreflexia, and numbness and tingling in the legs is suggestive of vitamin B12 deficiency. Decreased homocysteine levels are not seen in this condition. Rather, increased homocysteine levels are seen. Vitamin B12 is a cofactor of methionine synthase and methylmalonyl CoA mutase. Methionine synthase is required for the conversion of homocysteine to methionine, which is the principal methyl donor. In vitamin B12 deficiency, defective methionine synthase leads to the following: 1. In the absence of methionine, there is decreased methylation in the CNS. This leads to defective synthesis of myelin and neurotransmitters, which results in the following symptoms: Posterolateral cord degeneration: It presents as loss of proprioception and vibration, positive Romberg sign, ataxia, hyperreflexia, spasticity. Dementia leading to cognitive impairment. Peripheral neuropathy: presenting as muscle weakness, paresthesia. Optic atrophy. 2. Homocysteine accumulates in the blood, conferring an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. 3. Megaloblastic anemia: The availability of 5,10-methylene THF is reduced, which is required in the conversion of deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP) to thymidine monophosphate (TMP) for DNA synthesis. This leads to macrocytic anemia with megaloblasts in the bone marrow. Methionine-Folate Cycle: Methionine -> S-adenosylmethionine -> S-adenosylhomocysteine -> Homocysteine -> Serine -> Tetrahydrofolate. Methionine synthase (vitamin B12) -> 5-methyltetrahydrofolate. Cystathionine beta synthase (vitamin B6) -> Cystathionine -> Cysteine. MARROW: Glycine -> 5,10 methylenetetrahydrofolate -> methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase.",

        "D": "Folate therapy using the B12 stores"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The most likely cause is folate therapy which used up the B12 stores, aggravating the symptoms. Administration of folic acid for patients with macrocytic anemia can partially reverse the hematologic abnormalities associated with vitamin B12 deficiency. However, the neurologic manifestations of vitamin B12 deficiency are not treated by folic acid. Administration of folic acid to an individual with vitamin B12 deficiency can potentially mask untreated vitamin B12 deficiency or even worsen the neurologic complications. Hence, testing for and/or treatment of vitamin B12 deficiency is required in all patients being treated with folic acid. Supplemental folic acid can prevent macrocytic anemia, thus hiding vitamin B12 deficiency. Untreated vitamin B12 deficiency can cause irreversible nerve damage. Folic acid from food and supplements, active folate, proteins, amino acids, methionine, inactive folate: this form of folate, needed for the synthesis of DNA, cannot be made if vitamin B12 is deficient. The resulting folate deficiency causes macrocytic anemia. B12, homocysteine, vitamin B6, cysteine: folate and vitamin B12 are both needed to convert homocysteine to methionine. When either is deficient, homocysteine levels rise. MARROW: high blood levels in the blood increase cardiovascular disease risk.",
