      "explanation": "Neonates do not generate heat by shivering. Heat production in neonates happens by increasing the metabolic rate and oxygen consumption by releasing norepinephrine, which results in non-shivering thermogenesis through beta-oxidation of brown fat. This sympathetic surge also causes cutaneous vasoconstriction. Increased physical activity - crying, increased body movements, and muscular activity also contribute to thermogenesis. Preterm and small-for-gestational-age (SGA) infants have scanty brown fat stores.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) can be carried out by the mother or any other caregiver. KMC was introduced for the prevention of neonatal hypothermia in low birth weight/premature newborns. It has 4 components—•Skin-to-skin positioning of the newborn on the mother's chest. •Adequate nutrition through breastfeeding. •Early discharge and ambulatory care. •Support for mother and family for child care. Evidence shows that- •It is as good as incubators, in terms of safety and thermal protection (measured by mortality) •Reduces severe morbidity by way of facilitating breastfeeding •Humanization of neonatal care •Promoted bonding between mother and child. Eligibility criteria for KMC: It is indicated for all hemodynamically stable low birth weight babies. Short sessions of KMC can be initiated in babies on medical treatment like IV fluids or oxygen therapy. Initiation of KMC can vary with the birth weight of the baby. •Birth weight <1200 g - It may take days to weeks for initiation of KMC •Birth weight =1200-1800 g - Only a few days may be taken before KMC initiation •Birth weight >1800 g - KMC can be initiated immediately after birth. All mothers without any serious illness can provide KMC. Positioning for KMC: The baby is placed between the mother's breasts in an upright position. The hips are abducted and flexed in the frog position and the arms are also flexed. The abdomen of the baby should be at the level of the mother's epigastrium. In this position, the mother's breathing would stimulate the baby and prevent the development of apnea. The duration of KMC should be gradually increased from short sessions of more than one hour to 24 hours a day. KMC is not necessary once the baby attains 2500 g of weight or 37 weeks of gestation. Note: Incubatory care, feeding via nasal catheter, and prevention of infection are part of intensive care for low birthweight babies.",

Scarf sign: If the infant's arm is pulled medially across the chest, in a hypotonic infant, the elbow will cross the midline. In a term infant with a normal tone, the elbow will not reach the midline. Neuromuscular criteria for maturity (according to the expanded New Ballard score) include: posture, square window (wrist), arm recoil, popliteal angle, scarf sign, and heel to ear. Physical criteria for maturity (according to the expanded New Ballard score) include: skin, lanugo, eye/ear, plantar crease, breast, and genitals. The expanded New Ballard score is used to assess the physical and neuromuscular maturity of the newborn by scoring six criteria and thereby calculating the gestational age. It is accurate between 20 to 44 weeks.",

      "question": "While examining a healthy term neonate, you notice that the baby passes greenish-black-colored stools. This color is due to -",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The greenish-black color of the first stool in the newborn is due to biliverdin. Meconium is a dark, sticky material that is normally present in the intestine at birth and passed in the feces after birth. It is detected in the ileum at about 70-85 days of fetal life and begins to fill the colon and lower ileum late in the 4th month of gestation. The greenish color of the meconium is the consequence of the bile pigments excreted by the biliary tract. The main component responsible for the greenish color of the meconium is biliverdin (a pigment formed from the oxidation of bilirubin). Up to the 22nd week of gestation, the intestinal content is not greenish, and for this reason, fetal defecation would not stain the amniotic fluid. The production of biliverdin starts over the next few weeks or at a time closer to labor, probably due to a biochemical switch related to the bilirubin oxidation system. Bilirubin is responsible for the yellow color of the stools. Neonates do not harbor gut flora at birth.",

      "explanation": "The parachute reflex has its onset at 7-8 months of age. It is fully developed by 10-11 months of age and remains throughout life. It can be evoked by holding the infant's trunk and then suddenly lowering the infant as if he or she were falling. The arms will spontaneously extend to break the infant's fall.

        "C": "Hypoglycemia",
        "D": "Erb's palsy"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "A brisk Moro reflex can be seen in neonates with hypoglycemia. In hypoglycemic babies, there is an activation of the autonomic system, which results in jitteriness. Newborns often exhibit this as an exaggerated Moro reflex. The Moro reflex is a primitive reflex that is very sensitive to the infant's level of alertness. It is elicited by supporting the infant in the semi-erect position and allowing the infant's head to fall backward onto the examiner's hand. An animated gif of normal response to Moro's reflex, where there is symmetrical extension and abduction of the upper extremities, followed by flexion of the upper extremities, is shown below. The Moro reflex disappears by 6 months of age in normal infants. Absent Moro reflex: caused by significant generalized disturbance of the CNS, such as Stage III HIE and Kernicterus. Asymmetric Moro reflex: a feature of the root, plexus, or nerve disease, such as fractured clavicle, brachial plexus injury (Erb's palsy), and hemiparesis. Brisk Moro reflex: neonatal hypoglycemia, and can also be a normal variant in healthy infants, and Stage I HIE. Exaggerated, stereotyped, non-habituating Moro reflex is a feature of severe bilateral intrauterine cerebral disturbance, perhaps because of the release of the brain stem from inhibitory cortical influences. It is seen in conditions such as hydranencephaly and severe micrencephaly. Moro reflex in different stages of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE): Stage I HIE (mild): brisk, Stage II HIE (moderate): weak/incomplete, Stage III HIE (severe): absent. Option A: In kernicterus, there is a deposition of unconjugated bilirubin in the basal ganglia and brain stem. Hence, the Moro reflex is absent. Option C: In stage III HIE, the muscles are flaccid and the infant is comatose. Thus, the Moro reflex is absent. Option D: Erb's palsy results from an injury to the brachial plexus. So, the reflex is absent on the side of injury as the nerve supplying the muscles involved (efferent of the reflex) is affected.",
